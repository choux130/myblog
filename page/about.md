### Who am I?
Hi! I am Yin-Ting Chou, a Predictive Analyst/ Engineer Intern at [ChannelAdvisor](www.channeladvisor.com).
My motto is <em>**"Dream big, keep pursuing and never give up."**</em> And, I am also inspired by [Christopher Olah](http://colah.github.io/about.html)'s motto, <em>**"I want to understand things clearly, and explain them well."**</em>  <br /><br />

### Why I have started this blog?
Well, I think the reasons are...
  * **I have a bad memory! The more I learn, the more I forget.** <br />
    I need a place to organize all my learning and knowledge. It is not cool to spend time searching the same stuff again and again. And I expect, in the future, if I forget somethings, all I need to do is to search my website! <br />

  * **Writing down is a good way to internalize knowledge.** <br />
    After the experience of doing my masters thesis, I realize that only when I can write it down clearly do I truly understand it and am able to apply it in flexible ways. <br />

  * **Share and discuss.** <br />
    I have learned a lot a lot from others' blog and website. And now, it is finally the time for me to give back to others. <br /><br />

### My blogging journey was inspired by...
1.  [Ben Centra (a Web Developer)](http://bencentra.com/projects/2015/08/19/centrarium.html) <br />The beautiful website theme I use now is from Ben's excellent work.
2.  [Brenda Rocks (a Data Scientist)](https://brendanrocks.com/blogging-with-rmarkdown-knitr-jekyll/)
3.  [Jeff Goins (a Writer)](https://goinswriter.com/why-blog/)
4.  Sara Overby (a English Teacher) <br /> Sara is my English teacher at [Westwood Baptish Church](http://www.westwoodbc.org/neighborhood-ministries). She gives me the warmest support on learning English and writing my blog in English. <br /><br />

### What you expect to see in my website?
This website mainly includes statistical and machine learning methods and some data science knowledge. To master all these techniques, my learning process is like this.

**First**, I try to understand the theories behind them. Maybe because of my background, I think using mathematical formula is most logical and concise method to explain a concept. And, by doing some calculation, I can make sure everything is well grounded and supported by theory which really helps me think on the right track afterward. Briefly, a lot of math!

**Second**, I try to explain the ideas in a way that is easy to understand. Even though I do appreciate math, I also agree that math is on another planet! We all have more ideas about the world around than just math ideas. So, I love to collect people's interesting explanations of obscure ideas and then try to transform them in my own way by creating some small examples.

**Finally**, I like to transform the ideas smoothly on computers by doing some programming. I am an addicted [R](https://www.r-project.org) and [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com) user, but I also have interests in [Python](https://www.python.org), [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/), [SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/) and other languages. If codes are short, I will include them in the post, but if they are so long, I will put them in my [Github](https://github.com/choux130).

To sum up, you can expect to see math, interesting descriptions, codes and all the resources which I think are useful and would like to recommend to others. <br /><br />
