### Who am I? 
Hi! I am Yin-Ting Chou, a Masterâ€™s student of Statistics in University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. 

### Why I start this blog? 
Well, I think the reasons are... <br />
  * **I have bad memory! The more I learn, the more I forget.** <br />
    I need a place to organize all my learning process and knowledge. It is not cool to spend time on searching the same stuffs again and again. 
  * **Writing down is a good way to internalize knowledge.** <br />
    If I can clearly explaing what I learned and write it down, I believe that I truly understand the knowlege and am able to use it in a flexible way. 
  * **Share and discuss.** <br />
    I have learned a lot a lot from others' blog and website. And now, it is finally the time for me to give back to others. 
    
My journey to start blogging was also inspired by these people:
