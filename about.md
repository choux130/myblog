Hi! I am Yin-Ting Chou, a Master’s student of Statistics in University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. There are two main reasons for me to set up this website:

–  The more I learn, the more I forget. I need a place to orderly <span style="color:darkred"> **RECORD**</span> all my learning process and knowledge!

–  I want to <span style="color:darkred"> **SHARE** </span> with others as people always generously share with me!
