### Who am I?
Hi! I am Yin-Ting Chou, a Master’s student of Statistics in the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. My life goal is to become a person who can make the world become better by exercising my talents for data analysis and my passions for technology. <br /><br />

### Why I start this blog?
Well, I think the reasons are...
  * **I have bad memory! The more I learn, the more I forget.**
    I need a place to organize all my learning process and knowledge. It is not cool to spend time on searching the same stuffs again and again. Then, in the future, if I forgot somethings, all I need to do is to search my website! <br />

  * **Writing down is a good way to internalize knowledge.**
    After the experience of doing my master thesis, I realize that only when I can write it down clearly do I truly understand it and be able to apply it in flexible ways. <br />
    
  * **Share and discuss.** <br />
    I have learned a lot a lot from others' blog and website. And now, it is finally the time for me to give back to others. <br /><br />

### My blogging journey was inspired by...
1.  [Ben Centra (a Web Developer)](http://bencentra.com/projects/2015/08/19/centrarium.html) <br />The beautiful website theme I use now is from Ben's excellent work.
2.  [Brenda Rocks (a Data Scientist)](https://brendanrocks.com/blogging-with-rmarkdown-knitr-jekyll/)
3.  [Jeff Goins (a Writer)](https://goinswriter.com/why-blog/)  <br /><br />


### What you expect to see in my website?
This website mainly include all statistical and machine learning methods and some data science knowledges. To master all these techniques, my learning process are like this. 

**First**, try to understand the theories behind them. Maybe because of my background, I think using mathematical formula is most logical and concise methods to explain concept. And, by doing some caculation, I can make sure everything is well grounded and supported by theory which really helps me think on the right track afterward. Briefly, a lot math!

**Second**, be able to explain the ideas in a way that is easy to understand. Even though I do appreciate Math, I also agree that math is on the other planet! We all have more feelings to the stuffs around ourselves rather than math. So, I love to collect people's interesting explanation of obscure ideas and then try to mimic in my own way by creating some small examples. 

**Finally**, execute the ideas smoothly on machine by doing some programming. I am an addicted R and Rstudio user, but I also have interests in Python, HTML, SQL and other languages. If codes are short, I will include them in the post, but if it is long, I will put them in my [Github](https://github.com/choux130). 

To sum up, you can expect to see math, interesting descriptions, codes and all the resources which I think is useful and would like to recommend to others. <br /><br />
