### Who am I?
Hi! I am Yin-Ting Chou, a Master’s student of Statistics in the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. My life goal is to become a person who can make the world become better by exercising my talents for data analysis and my passions for technology.  

### Why I start this blog?
Well, I think the reasons are...
  * **I have bad memory! The more I learn, the more I forget.**
    I need a place to organize all my learning process and knowledge. It is not cool to spend time on searching the same stuffs again and again. Then, in the future, if I forgot somethings, all I need to do is search my website.<br />

  * **Writing down is a good way to internalize knowledge.**
    After the experience of doing my master thesis, I realize that only when I can write it down clearly do I truly understand it and be able to apply it in flexible ways. <br />
    
  * **Share and discuss.** <br />
    I have learned a lot a lot from others' blog and website. And now, it is finally the time for me to give back to others.

### My blogging journey was inspired by...
1.  [Ben Centra (a Web Developer)](http://bencentra.com/projects/2015/08/19/centrarium.html) <br />The beautiful website theme I use now is from Ben's excellent work.
2.  [Brenda Rocks (a Data Scientist)](https://brendanrocks.com/blogging-with-rmarkdown-knitr-jekyll/)
