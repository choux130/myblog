### Who am I?
Hi! I am Yin-Ting Chou, a Masterâ€™s student of Statistics in the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. My life goal is to become a person who can make the world become better by exercising my talents for data analysis and my passions for technology.  

### Why I start this blog?
Well, I think the reasons are...
  * **I have bad memory! The more I learn, the more I forget.**
    I need a place to organize all my learning process and knowledge. It is not cool to spend time on searching the same stuffs again and again. <br />

  * **Writing down is a good way to internalize knowledge.**
    If I can clearly explaing what I learned and write it down, I believe that I truly understand the knowlege and am able to use it in a flexible way. <br />
  * **Share and discuss.** <br />
    I have learned a lot a lot from others' blog and website. And now, it is finally the time for me to give back to others.

### My blogging journey was inspired by...
