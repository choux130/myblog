Here are some topics that I would like to write posts about in the near future. And I have three categories for the upcoming posts:
  * **Editing** <br />
    I already have a draft about this topic. After revising some text layouts, it can be posted in a short time.
  * **Drafting** <br />
    I am familiar with the topic and am trying to make the posts looks more complete by gathering more information about it.
  * **Having an idea** <br />
