### Overview
Moving Average is so famous in predictive models for its fast, simplicity and easily understood formula. By adding subjective weights on the formula, it can even be closer to your needs. And, after series of testing on the data on my work, it is no doubt that in some situations its accuracy is so satisfied and even outperforms the other more complex models. Besides taking it as a predictive model, many people use it as a smoother of their data which can help them see their data more clearly and by removing some noises. In this post, I will cover many moving average formula that I have seen when I am doing research about this model. And, I will have the other post related to its R code.
